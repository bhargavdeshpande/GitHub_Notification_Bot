https://github.ncsu.edu/bbdeshpa/csc510-project/blob/master/Final_Demo.mp4


## Problem

One of the issues while developing software using GitHub is not being notified or missing notifications about updates in the repository. Due to the complexities of modern agile software development, developers have to manage multiple tools parallelly. This may cause them to miss important notifications that are relevant to them and the overall development of the project.

Missing notifications can lead to problems that slow down the development process and hamper production software quality. Irregular git pulls may lead to merge conflicts which can be difficult to resolve. These conflicts can sometimes slow down development process as resolving them is tedious and time consuming. Also, in a project it is important to be immediately notified about issues being created as sometimes these issues might be security/scalability vulnerability bugs. Thus, making it important to resolve them promptly. In addition to these, it is also important to know the tasks being completed while working parallelly on a project so that the future tasks can be planned accordingly.

## Features

### [1] Synchronising GitHub with bot 

This feature included several steps that consisted of installing the extension and providing a correct personal access token in order to access the notifications from GitHub.
