### Tasks carried out during deployment

## (1) To notify the user that an update is available for the app

We have created a function that checks the version number in the manifest file on the master branch. Incase there is a difference in the version number in the remote repo and the local app, the chrome bot notifies the user that the app has been updated by displaying a message in the bot.
