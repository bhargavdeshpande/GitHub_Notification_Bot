## Sprint 1

Sprint 1 focuses on the research of various tools that will be used for deployment purpose.

Since in the previous milestone, synchronising bot with GitHub was achieved through mocking data. The Sprint 1 in Milestone 3 focused more on actual implementation, i.e, interaction of the bot with the GitHub API.
